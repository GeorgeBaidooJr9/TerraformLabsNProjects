# Learn Terraform State Management

This repo is a companion repo to the [Learn Terraform State Management](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/state-cli) tutorial.
It contains Terraform configuration you can use to learn how to create an AWS instance and security group, examine a state file, and then manipulate resources to observe how vital state is to your Terraform operations.
